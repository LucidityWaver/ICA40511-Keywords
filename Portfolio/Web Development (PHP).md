##Web Design Assessment Task

###The Project
For the web development component of Holmesglen's IT Cert IV Programming course, students were required to design and create a website for the fictional company Hamilton IT Consulting. The website should follow the web design principles detailed in the course and facilitate interaction with a MySQL database using PHP.

###The Completed Website

The website includes three content pages, a semi functional PHP login and pages using PHP for database interaction.

To create the core of the website I implemented a three-column fluid-grid layout using CSS. This system moves content in from the edge of the screen to create a better aesthetic and allows for accessibility across different screen sizes. The design needed to be altered for the contact-us page to suit an embedded map across two columns.

The design can be seen in the images below.

Tables to view information from the database and forms for inserting or updating records are generated dynamically using table column information.
